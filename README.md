Elias of Dereham Project

Elias of Dereham is an IOS app that tells the story of Elias of Dereham, a master stonemason who delivered copies of the Magna Carta to Salisbury Cathedral.

The app is a endless runner game, where players must dodge obstacles so Elias can bring the Magna Carta to Salisbury Cathedral. The game takes inspiration from tapestry, with the story told as the player progresses through the English countryside.

The app was created as a group project for the second year project for Digital Media Design at Bournemouth University and in collaboration with Salisbury Cathedral for the 800 year anniversary of the Magna Carta's creation.

For the project I was lead developer, which included coding the game. I also designed and created the background characters. Collaboratively we came up with the idea and the story for the game. 

Collaborators on this project are: Sam Pothecary, Charlotte Strethill-Smith, Harley Stevens, Sabha Al Maskri and myself, Libby Odai.
